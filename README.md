# Quiz

Completed by Joshua Diaz

## Summary

This project is a simple quiz application that I created to demonstrate basic skills in DOM manipulation using Javascript. Upon starting the quiz the user is presented with the first question and a timer starts. After an answer is submitted the score is recorded and the following question is presented, the process continues until the game is complete and all the questions have been answered. Once the game is completed the questions are replaced with prompt that says "thanks for playing" and the user is given a text field to input their initials. After submitting their initials, the user is added to the leaderboard with their score attached to their name. The game resets after the player information is submitted, the leaderboard is produced through usage of the local storage.
